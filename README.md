I have use visual studio for making and demonstrating the project 
	
 
 
 
 There are two file .py file one_shot.py and app.py , detection.json

 Detection.json where the logs are there means the detected object is

I have also provide the sample video detection


Problem faced:

I have make this project in cpu instead of gpu

Improvement:

work good in gpu and and optimize the threshold to 0.05
